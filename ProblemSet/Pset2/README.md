# Problem Set 2 - Arrays and Strings

This folder contains my solutions for **CS50 Problem Set 2**, which focuses on arrays, strings, and basic algorithms in C.

## Programs Included

### scrabble.c
- Calculates the Scrabble score of a word entered by the user.  
- Reinforced my understanding of arrays and mapping values to letters.  
- Key learning: Iterating over strings, handling character cases, and using arrays to store data efficiently.

### readability.c
- Implements the Coleman-Liau index to determine the reading level of a text.  
- Strengthened my skills in string manipulation, counting letters, words, and sentences, and applying formulas to real-world data.  
- Key learning: Breaking down a problem into measurable components and ensuring accurate calculations.

### substitution.c
- Encrypts text using a user-provided substitution cipher.  
- Deepened my understanding of arrays, character indexing, and input validation.  
- Key learning: Mapping characters from one set to another, handling upper- and lowercase letters, and ensuring unique key constraints.

## Key Concepts Learned
- Arrays and their practical applications  
- Strings and string manipulation in C  
- Iterating over text and performing calculations or transformations  
- Input validation and handling edge cases  
- Writing modular, readable, and well-commented code

## Notes
- Each file includes inline comments explaining logic and approach.  
- These exercises built a stronger foundation in working with data structures, preparing me for algorithms and memory management in later problem sets.
