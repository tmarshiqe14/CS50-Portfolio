# Problem Set 1 - C Basics

This folder contains my solutions for **CS50 Problem Set 1**, which introduces fundamental concepts in C programming such as loops, conditionals, and basic algorithms.

## Programs Included

### mario.c
- Builds a half-pyramid of `#` characters based on user input for height.  
- Reinforced my understanding of nested loops, input validation, and control flow in C.  
- Key learning: Constructing patterns using loops and thinking algorithmically about row-by-row output.

### credit.c
- Validates credit card numbers using Luhnâ€™s algorithm and determines card type (AMEX, MASTERCARD, VISA).  
- Strengthened my skills in loops, conditionals, integer arithmetic, and algorithm implementation.  
- Key learning: Breaking down a real-world validation problem into logical steps and ensuring correctness with multiple test cases.

## Key Concepts Learned
- Variables, data types, and arithmetic operations in C  
- Loops (`for`, `while`) and nested loops  
- Conditional statements (`if/else`)  
- Input handling and validation  
- Writing clean, readable, and well-commented code  
- Implementing real-world algorithms programmatically

## Notes
- Each file includes inline comments explaining the logic and approach.  
- These exercises laid the foundation for more advanced programming topics in subsequent problem sets.
