# Problem Set 3 - Elections

This folder contains my solutions for **CS50 Problem Set 3**, which focuses on algorithms, arrays, and data structures in the context of election simulations.

## Programs Included

### plurality.c
- Implements a simple **plurality voting system**, where each voter selects one candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins.  
- Reinforced my understanding of arrays, loops, and counting algorithms.  
- Key learning: Efficiently storing and updating vote counts, validating input, and handling ties.

### tideman.c
- Implements a **ranked-choice election** using Tidemanâ€™s (or Ranked Pairs) algorithm.  
- Deepened my skills with arrays, matrices, and more complex algorithmic logic.  
- Key learning: Creating and traversing a directed graph to determine the winner without cycles, handling multiple voters and rankings, and ensuring correct ordering.

## Key Concepts Learned
- Arrays and two-dimensional arrays (matrices)  
- Loops and conditional logic for counting and ranking  
- Implementing algorithms to simulate real-world processes  
- Validating user input and handling edge cases  
- Writing clean, readable, and well-commented code

## Notes
- Each file includes inline comments explaining the logic and approach.  
- These exercises strengthened my u
